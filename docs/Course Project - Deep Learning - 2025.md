**Course Project \- Deep Learning – Fall 2025 \[1\] Requirements:** 

Key frame detection using deep Learning Techniques. 

Input: 30 Second colored Video (picked from the internet) 

Output: detected key frames 

• You may try two deep learning techniques. 

• Please mention the dataset used to train both models 

• Discuss the results and Compare between the output of the two models • Deep analysis of the problem and proposed solutions is a must. • Models should be depicted as block diagrams 

**\[2\] Project guideline** 

• Projects are on groups (3 students ONLY \- No individuals) 

• Use any programming languages (Python, Flask , Django, ...etc) 

**Latest Deadline is Friday 21 Dec Mid night.** 

**Project Code, Report and Presentation should be submitted before the deadline. Project Report file is in pdf format. it should contain the following sections:** • Personal Info (Names, IDs , Supervisor, Project title,...) 

• **Problem description**  
• Full **analysis** of the problem 

• **Samples** picked from the videos frames 

• **Models Designs**, with Diagrams. 

• **Explain** each model , how does it work. Theory of operation • **Analysis and Discussion** of Models output (this is very important) • Sample results 

• Explain **how to enhance** the model (new Ideas) 

**\[3\] Evaluation will be based on:** 

▪ Project Report (the pdf) 

▪ System Design  

▪ Results and discussions 

▪ Requirements Fulfillment (check list of requirements)  ▪ Code Review Grade
